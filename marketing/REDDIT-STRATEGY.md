## 5 READY-TO-POST REDDIT THREADS

### POST 1 — r/Omegle
**Title:** "For everyone still looking for an Omegle replacement — found one that actually feels right"

"Been trying different random chat sites since Omegle went down. Most of them are either dead, sketchy, or just straight up don't work.

Found this one called Freak last week — freak-app-2025.netlify.app — and it's the closest I've felt to the original Omegle experience but cleaner. No download, just opens in your browser. Has a Skip/Stop setup like you'd expect.

The one thing that's different is there's this little Crushes tab where you can save people you actually connect with and message them later with actual chat (gifs, photos etc). Feels like a natural evolution.

Anyway just sharing because I know people here have been looking."

**Comment to post yourself 5 mins later:**
"For anyone wondering — it works on phone too, I've been using it on Safari. The camera permission popup is the only thing you have to allow."

### POST 2 — r/MakeNewFriendsHere
**Title:** "This is how I've been meeting people online when I don't want to do the whole app profile thing"

"I hate making profiles. Bio, photos, all of it. Too much commitment.

Started using Freak (freak-app-2025.netlify.app) — it's a video chat thing where you just click Start and you're instantly talking to a random person. No account required. If they suck, skip. If they're cool, you can add them as a crush and actually chat later.

Had some actually solid conversations on there. Way more fun than swiping on people's photos and guessing if they're normal.

Anyone else doing this kind of thing? What else works for you guys?"

### POST 3 — r/lonely
**Title:** "Weird thing that helped when I was going through a really isolating period"

"Not sure if this is the right place to post this but I've been seeing others share things that helped them so here's mine.

Earlier this year I went through a stretch where I felt really disconnected from people around me. Started using random video chat just to feel like I was talking to humans. Sounds pathetic written out but it genuinely helped.

There's one called Freak (freak-app-2025.netlify.app) — I liked it because there's no pressure. You just click a button, someone shows up, you talk. If it's awkward you skip. No profile, no judgment. Some nights I'd just talk to 4-5 random people and feel way more connected after.

Not a cure obviously but it helped me get out of my head during a hard time. Sharing in case it helps anyone."

### POST 4 — r/InternetIsBeautiful
**Title:** "Freak — clean Omegle-style random video chat with a crushes feature [OC]"

"freak-app-2025.netlify.app

Built this random video chat app. Black and hot pink design. Click Start, you're immediately matched with someone. Skip or Stop when you want. If you meet someone cool you can add them as a Crush — saves them to a tab where you can actually chat (texts, GIFs, photos).

No login. No download. Works in browser. Free.

Happy to answer questions."

### POST 5 — r/SocialAnxiety
**Title:** "Random video chat helped me practice talking to strangers — here's my experience"

"I have pretty bad social anxiety in person. Eye contact, pauses in conversation, reading people — all exhausting.

Someone suggested trying random chat apps as low-stakes social practice. The logic being: if it goes badly you just skip, no real consequences, and you get reps in.

I've been using Freak (freak-app-2025.netlify.app) for a few weeks. Here's what I noticed:
- The skip button removes all the anxiety about 'how do I end this'
- You get better at opening conversations fast
- Some conversations are actually really good and it builds confidence
- There's a Crushes tab to save people you actually connect with

Not saying it fixes anxiety but it's a genuinely low-pressure environment to practice. Curious if others have tried this."
