# FREAK — Influencer Outreach Pack

---

## TIER STRATEGY

### Nano (1k–10k) — START HERE
- **Volume play** — reach out to 50+ at once
- **Offer:** Early access + free premium (when it exists) + genuine shoutout
- **Expected result:** 2-5% conversion, 5-10% of their audience will try the app
- **Best niches:** college life, bored/humor, social experiments, reaction content
- **Why they work:** Higher engagement rates, more authentic, less cynical about new products

### Micro (10k–100k) — MAIN FOCUS
- **Best ROI** tier for a new app
- **Offer:** Revenue share (5-10% of premium signups via tracking link), exclusive partnership title
- **Expected result:** 1 viral post from this tier can drive 5k-20k signups
- **Best niches:** reaction content, social experiment, Gen-Z lifestyle, random chat interest

### Mid-tier (100k–500k) — SELECTIVE
- Focus on creators who already make random chat content
- **Offer:** Paid collaboration once you have revenue, or equity if it's a huge fit
- One mid-tier creator who genuinely uses the app = massive credibility signal

### Macro (500k+) — PLAY THE LONG GAME
- Don't cold DM. Build signal first.
- Strategy: If smaller creators make viral content, macro creators will notice and cover it organically
- Alternative: Find macro creators who are Omegle nostalgic and send a warm intro

## 10 DM/EMAIL TEMPLATES

### Template 1 — Reaction Creator (TikTok)
**Subject:** Your [specific video] made me build something

Hey [Name],

Watched your reaction content and immediately thought of Freak — a random video chat app I just launched (freak-app-2025.netlify.app).

No download. No login. Just click Start and you're connected to a random person. Skip anyone. There's also a Crushes feature to save people you actually like.

Would love for you to try it and film your honest reaction. If you want to collab, I'm open to rev share or an early partnership deal.

Up to you — no pressure either way.

[Your name]

### Template 2 — College Content Creator
**Subject:** Built something your audience would actually use

Hey [Name],

You make college content and I just launched Freak (freak-app-2025.netlify.app) — a clean random video chat app, kind of like Omegle but actually well-designed.

Your audience would be the perfect fit. Thought I'd reach out directly before going to agencies.

Happy to set up rev share on any sign-ups from your link. Worth a convo?

### Template 3 — Social Anxiety / Connection Creator
**Subject:** App your audience would actually find helpful

Hey [Name],

You make content about [social skills/loneliness/connection] and I built something that fits — Freak (freak-app-2025.netlify.app).

Random video chat with a Skip button — basically low-stakes practice for talking to strangers. A lot of people with social anxiety have found it genuinely helpful.

Not asking you to hype it. Just asking if you'd try it and share your honest take. If it resonates with your audience I'd love to work together.

### Template 4 — Former Omegle Content Creator
**Subject:** Built the Omegle replacement you've been waiting for

Hey [Name],

Saw your [old Omegle video / post about Omegle shutting down] — I built Freak as the answer to that: freak-app-2025.netlify.app

Same concept, way cleaner. Browser-based, no login, Skip/Stop controls, and a Crushes tab to save real connections.

Would love to give you early access and see what you think. Open to a collab if it fits your channel.

### Template 5 — Humor Creator
**Subject:** Your next video idea is already built

Hey [Name],

What if I told you there's an app that's basically a chaos machine in your browser? freak-app-2025.netlify.app — random video chat, instant matching, skip anyone you want.

The content writes itself tbh. I'd love to see you cover it. Happy to do rev share if you want to post your link.

## CONTENT BRIEF FOR CREATORS

**What to make:** 15-60 second video of your genuine first-time experience

**The flow that works:**
1. Open freak-app-2025.netlify.app (film screen + your face)
2. Enter a name, hit Start
3. React naturally to whoever shows up
4. Skip 2-3 times to show the feature
5. Optional: show the Crush feature at the end

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't read a script
- Don't make it feel like an ad
- Don't skip too fast (let a real moment happen)

**The goal:** Authentic chaos. That's what sells this app.
