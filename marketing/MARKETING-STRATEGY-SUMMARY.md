## 🎯 Core Strategy: The Viral Loop

### The Freaky Viral Loop:
1. **Creator uses Freaky** for authentic content
2. **Amazing conversation happens** (real, unscripted)
3. **Creator shares clip** on TikTok/Twitter/YouTube
4. **Clip goes viral** because it's genuinely authentic
5. **Viewers discover Freaky** and want to try it themselves
6. **New users create more viral content** → Loop repeats

This self-sustaining growth engine is the foundation of our entire strategy.
