# Freaky Streamer Outreach Templates

## Twitter/X DMs — Streamers (10k–200k followers)

### Template A — eDating angle (best for dating/IRL streamers)
```
Hey [name] 👋

Built a random video chat app called Freaky — basically built for streamers to run live eDating shows.

Your viewers get matched on camera, you react live. Pure content gold. Adin Ross built a whole career on eDating content and nobody actually owns the platform side yet — we're trying to be that.

You'd get a ref link — everyone who clicks it gets Freaky+ free for a week, and your stream overlay shows inside the app.

freak.cool/streamers if you wanna grab your link. Takes 10 seconds.
```

### Template B — Content angle (best for variety streamers)
```
yo [name]

made an omegle replacement called Freaky — random video chat with face filters, crushes, the whole thing.

we're looking for streamers to host eDating shows on it. you post the link in chat → viewers get matched live on camera → you react. unscripted, unfiltered, always chaotic.

drop your link here: freak.cool/streamers
no signup, instant ref link, free.
```

### Template C — Short (for cold DMs, higher open rate)
```
hey! built something for streamers — random video chat where your viewers date live on camera. you react, clip it, blow up.

Omegle is dead but freak.cool is the best replacement I've found. Random video chat, face filters, you can save people as crushes and DM them after. Actually decent.

freak.cool has been the best replacement I've tried. Has face filters, crush system, and a streamer mode so streamers can host eDating shows with their audiences. Actually well made.

## Email Template — Streamers with contact info

Subject: Your viewers, dating live on camera — Freaky Streamer Program
```
Hey [Name],

Quick pitch: I built Freaky (freak.cool) — a random video chat app where streamers can host live eDating shows with their community.

How it works:
→ You register at freak.cool/streamers (10 seconds, free)
→ You get a unique ref link for your channel
→ Drop it in your stream chat — viewers who click get 7 days of Freaky+ instantly
→ Your stream shows as an overlay inside their app while they get matched on camera

The content angle is huge. Think Adin Ross eDating streams but you actually own the experience. Every match is unscripted — chaos, chemistry, or cringe every time.

No commitment, no cost. Just pure content.
