# Freaky TikTok Creator Kit 🎵

## The Pitch (1 sentence)
"Your followers get matched with strangers on camera, live — you film their reactions."

---

## Who to Target

### Tier 1 — HIGHEST PRIORITY
These TikTok niches eat this type of content alive:

| Niche | Why | Search Terms |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| Dating advice girls 18-25 | "I tried random video chat" = instant views | #datingadvice #singlelife |
| Social experiment creators | Strangers on camera = their whole brand | #socialexperiment |
| "Day in my life" creators | Relatable + chat content | #dayinmylife |
| Omegle/random chat niche | Direct audience overlap | #omegle #randomchat |
| Comedy/reaction creators | Weird strangers = content gold | #funny |
| Gen Z dating culture | Tinder discourse, dating rant creators | #genz #dating |

### Tier 2 — SECONDARY
- IRL streamers (cross-post TikTok content)
- "Girls be like / guys be like" creators
- Campus/college life creators
- Relationship status update creators ("I'm single again" → try Freaky)

## TikTok DM Templates

### Template 1 — Content angle (BEST for bigger creators)
```
hey [name]! huge fan of your content 🔥

built a random video chat app called Freaky (freak.cool) and honestly think 
it would be insane content for your page

your viewers could use your link to get matched live on camera — you film 
their reactions / your own session and post it. zero script, pure chaos every time

i can give you a creator code so all your followers get Freaky+ free when 
they sign up — builds your community inside the app too

lmk if you wanna try it — happy to send over everything you need
```

### Template 2 — Short/casual (best for mid-size creators)
```
yo! built a random video chat app called Freaky that i think would make 
crazy content for your page 👀

basically your followers get matched on camera with strangers — film their 
reactions and you have a viral video

creator code = your followers get free Freaky+. takes 10 seconds to set up

freak.cool/streamers if you wanna grab your link
```

### Template 3 — Hook-first (best for dating niche creators)
```
okay so hear me out — what if you posted a video of trying an omegle 
replacement app but it actually works and you end up vibing with someone 😭

that's literally what happens on Freaky (freak.cool) — it's random video 
chat with face filters and a "crushes" system to keep talking after

happy to give you a free creator code so your followers get Freaky+ too. 
think your audience would love it
```

## Content Hooks for Creators (give them these ideas)

These are ready-to-film TikTok video concepts:

1. **"I tried the new Omegle replacement and..."** — classic format, always performs
2. **"Setting my followers up on a blind date live"** — use date mode
3. **"I wore the [Peanut/Clown/Devil] filter the whole time"** — filter content
4. **"Random video chat but with Snapchat filters on"** — that's literally the app
5. **"I found my type in 5 minutes"** — crush/match story content
6. **"POV: you just got matched with a stranger wearing a devil filter"** — reaction content
7. **"This app is dangerous"** / **"This app is addicting"** — proven viral hooks

## The Creator Code Incentive

What creators get:
- Unique ref link tied to their handle (freak.cool?ref=HANDLE)
- Their followers get **7 days Freaky+ free** when they sign up
- Stream overlay shows inside the app (their Twitch/YouTube link)
- "Brought by [Creator]" badge for new users from their link
- Priority support + early access to new features

---

## Follow-Up (if no response after 3 days)
```
hey! just wanted to follow up on Freaky — we just added some insane new 
face filters (melting face, chipmunk cheeks, cyclops, funhouse mirror) 
that are literally made for TikTok content 😭

still happy to set up your creator code if you want to try it
freak.cool
```

## Platforms to DM Creators

1. **TikTok DMs** — primary
2. **Instagram DMs** — backup (most TikTok creators have IG)
3. **Twitter/X** — if they're active there
4. **Email** — link in their bio

## Volume Goal
- Week 1: 50 DMs sent
- Week 2: 100 DMs sent
- Target: 3-5 creators who actually post content = hundreds of signups
