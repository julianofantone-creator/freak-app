# Freak 🔥

**Mission:** Build the wildest, most addictive random video chat platform that streamers will actually want to use for viral content.

## ✨ What We Built

A complete, production-ready random video chat application with:

- **Real-time backend** with Socket.io and WebRTC signaling
- **Psychological engagement hooks** built into the core experience

5. **Social proof** - Live user counts, connection quality ratings
