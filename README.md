## What it is

Freak is the cleanest Omegle alternative built after Omegle shut down. Instant random video chat — click Start, meet someone, Skip or Stop. If you vibe with someone, add them as a Crush and keep the conversation going in a full chat (text, GIFs, photos).

No account. No download. Just open it and go.

## Features

- ⚡ Instant random video matching
- ⏭ Skip anyone in one tap
- 💕 Crushes — save people you like and chat later
- 🎞 Full chat: text, GIFs (Tenor), photo uploads  
- 📱 Mobile-first, works on any device
- 🔒 18+ only, no accounts required
